She was always professional, from the beginning planning stages all the way through to the day of our wedding. She approached her role with pure reverence, helping us to choose time-honored music that celebrates our Lord and the beauty of matrimony. We got several comments about how our wedding was "one of the most beautiful weddings I have ever been to!" and we credit Maryruth's vocals and the officiating priest entirely. Maryruth is a joy to work with and we recommend her without hesitation."</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">“Playing the harp had been a dream of mine since I was seven years old- and thanks to Ruthie, that dream became a reality. I began taking lessons with Ruthie soon after I told my dad I wanted to play, and I loved every single minute of it. Ruthie taught me traditional classical pieces, and also made sure we had fun with different music styles such as Disney, pop, and improv. She taught me precious skills to play a variety of music, and, most importantly, she taught me to love playing the harp, and I can’t thank her enough for that.<br>I’ve now played in three different music ensemble groups and have been hired for weddings, events and concerts, and I don’t think I’d have been able to do everything I do today without Ruthie’s constant support and encouragement. She’s someone I look up to, and I’m so blessed to have her as a teacher and friend.<br>If you’re ever looking for a harp instructor, my immediate suggestion would be Ruthie; she’s fun, ridiculously skilled, and just a super rad teacher.”</p>

                                <p>For formal events and concerts I usually wear a black concert gown. For day events or more casual bookings I wear professional concert attire, such as a dress or pants suit. If you have a particular color or theme you would like me to wear please make the request, I will do my best to coordinate my attire.</p>

                                <h3>Is it hard to move the harp? Where can you play?</h3>
                                <p>While a harp can be tricky to move, I has performed in some pretty exciting venues including beaches, outdoor parks, and even a trip under the stars in the deserts of Arizona! Please don't hesitate to ask what options we have on moving the harp.</p>

                                <p>I charge $30 for 30 minutes and $60 for an hour. The rate is the same whether it be for piano, harp or voice lessons.</p>

                                <h3>Do you teach students to read music?</h3>
                                <p>YES! Learning to read music is a very important skill and whether it be for piano, harp, or voice, be prepared to learn to read music and to apply basic theory as a part of your lessons.</p>

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted"></p>

                                 <h3>What is my first lesson on harp like?</h3>
                                <p>If you have never played the harp before, we will begin by getting to know the instrument. I will teach you proper posture and how to hold your hands to pluck the strings. We will also learn the names of some of the notes and get you started on how to practice and tune your instrument. You do not need to own or rent a harp before your first lesson. You are welcome to come in for a lesson to get to know the instrument, and we can discuss any questions you might have about lessons and acquiring a harp.</p>

                                <h3>What type of harp do I need?</h3>
                                <p>There are two main types of harps that most harpists play on (at least here in the USA). One is called the Pedal Harp (or Concert Harp), and the other is a Lever Harp (or Folk Harp). The main difference is in size and the method of playing. Pedal harps have a series of pedals on the floor that harpists use, while a Lever harp has a series of levers along the neck.<br> Generally, I like to start my students on a lever harp as they are lighter, smaller, and more affordable. However, this is not always the case, nor does it have to be. I will help walk you through the purchasing or renting of a harp if you need help! It is not as daunting a task as you might think at first.</p>

                                <h3>Where can I get a harp?</h3>
                                <p>There are many places where you can rent and/or purchase a harp. I will be happy to help you find the perfect instrument for you.</p>

                                <h2>Voice Lessons</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted"></p>

                                <h3>What type of training do you offer in voice?</h3>
                                <p>I offer classical vocal training where students will learn techniques in breathing and proper singing that will enable them to sing classical vocal repertoire. This foundation however does not lock them into this genre. While some do perform, the vast majority of my students do not perform in classical situations. Most perform in musical theatre, jazz, or other contemporary venues. It is not my goal to make each student an opera singer (unless that is your dream), but rather to utilize good classical technique in order to enable students to best use their voice. I do not teach a particular genre or a particular “method.” <br>Students are required to work on a classical song of my choosing, and then are given the freedom to choose a song of their choosing to work on as well. Together, I try to teach the student that good technique is good technique no matter what you are singing. <br> Students are also encouraged to perform in choirs, theatrical productions, or other performances besides our studio recitals. Students are welcome and encouraged to bring music for other events to their lessons as I can often offer support.</p>

                                <h3>What should I expect for my first voice lesson?</h3>
                                <p>The purpose of the first voice lesson is for me to evaluate your voice (Soprano, Tenor, Mezzo, etc.) and to get an idea of who you are, and what you want to sing! So please be ready to sing your favorite song and to do some funny sounding warm ups with me! These will help me get an idea of where your voice is. From there I will give you a plan of action that is personalized to help you progress and succeed as a vocalist.</p>

                                <h3>What generally happens in a voice lesson?</h3>
                                <p>It depends on what we are working on, but the general structure is that we spend some time warming up. It is during these warm ups that we work on the technical stuff and is often where the magic happens! Following this we will work on repertoire, or the songs you are working on. I require all my voice students to learn to read music, so we work on this as well. </p>

                                <h3>What do I need for voice lessons?</h3>
                                <p>Students will generally be given a book to purchase and songs to download and bring into lessons throughout the course of study. I also encourage students to record their lessons for practice. Besides that, you just need your voice and a bottle of water!</p>

                                <h3>What should I expect for my first piano lesson?</h3>
                                <p>The first piano lesson is a great opportunity for me to evaluate your musical knowledge and get you started on a personalized road of study that will help you accomplish your goals as a piano player! If you are new to the piano, I will teach you about the instrument and correct posture, and we will pick out a book from the store (B&H Music) that is proper for your age and ability. The books I use generally cost between $10 and $15. From there we will learn the names of some notes and get you started on your first practice assignments!</p>

                                <h3>What type of songs will I learn to play?</h3>
                                <p>I personalize my lessons for each student depending on their personal goals as a musician. With that being said, there are some fundamental techniques and knowledge that every piano player should know. These things I insist on. Generally, beginning students will work through a method book in order to develop good technique and practice habits. As a student advances, I will supplement the method book with chosen pieces that will help them advance. I also encourage students to find pieces that they are excited to work on in addition to their lesson music. Basic study in music theory is also a part of every piano student's lesson.</p>
